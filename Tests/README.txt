Here is how we tested our project:

Our .NET Web Application:
For our Web App, we coded in Microsoft Visual Studio. In this program,
we were able to write our code and then build and run it locally.
It simulated a website on the local computer and we were able to debug 
just like that.

Our Android Application:

To test the Android App we compiled the code in Android Studios and then ran it on an LG V35 ThinQ running Android 8.0.0. 
To test we navigated the app and made sure that everything worked as expected by using the app in hand. This allowed us to debug accurately and quickly.
One user Login that works is username = "nick@gmail.com" and password = "pass". However you may also test by creating your own user account.
