Welcome to our data folder. 
For our project, we hosted an SQL database on Microsoft Azure. 
This was the back end for our Web Application, Android App, and Alexa Skill.
Our SQL database was made up of six tables(Company, CompanyStock, Game, GameUser, User and UserStock). 
In this folder you will find DatabaseSchema.sql which is an executable file that will regenerate our Database.
Also, for each table we exported the tuples into a PDF file with the format: <table name>Data.pdf
